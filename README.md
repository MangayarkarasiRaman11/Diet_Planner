# Diet_Planner

This project introduces an AI-Powered Fitness and Diet Planner Web Application that delivers highly personalized workout and diet plans using advanced natural language processing and large language models. Built using Streamlit, the application employs the LangChain framework with GROQ's LLaMA3 model to dynamically generate structured health plans tailored to individual user needs.

Users can input various personal details, including workout goals, diet preferences, current and target weight, age, gender, and health conditions. Based on this information, the AI generates:

A custom diet plan organized weekly

A personalized workout schedule over the selected number of weeks

The application also features an interactive chatbot that allows users to ask follow-up questions about their plans, enhancing engagement and clarity. Additional functionalities include a visually styled background using base64-encoded images and responsive layout design with split sections for input and output.
